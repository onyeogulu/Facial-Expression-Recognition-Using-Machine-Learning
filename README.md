# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Using-Machine-Learning

This project provides an exhaustive experimentation with two machine learning classifiers (SVM and ANN) on two Grammatical facial expressions dataset (affirmative and conditional). Accuracy score was considered as primary performance metric for selecting the optimal model while AUC/ROC and F1-scores are considered as secondary performance metrics.
